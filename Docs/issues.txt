# Shutdown hooks and JVM behaviour

What happened:

Tested the behaviour of a simple java programm with and without shutdown hooks.

Without shutdown hooks the JVM exits with exit code 0. The JVM exits abruptly on CTRL+C.
Didn't check the exit code.

With shutdown hooks the JVM exits with exit code 130 on CTRL+C (oracle Java 8 and OpenJDK 21).
With shutdown hooks the JVM exits with a negative exit code on CTRL+C (Oracle 20 & 21 JDK).
The JVM shuts down but when running from DOS Batch console input is required to release
the console.
Didn't check yet normal exit behaviour as console application is yet being refactored.

There seems to be an issue with oracles JVM and exit behavior with shutdown hooks.
Maybe it's an issue since indtroduction of lightweight threads?

Need to test behaviour in linux and windows when starting the java program from script.
There might be additional issues with start /B /Wait under windows.

Need to test killing the java process under linux and windows (CTRL+C and kill command).
